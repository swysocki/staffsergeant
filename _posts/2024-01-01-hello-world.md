Congrats, it appears that everything is working.  Now go ahead
and replace this post with your own.  While you're at it add some CSS to the
`_styles` directory.  SSG has no style and looks like a vestige of the 80's.

Once you have added CSS, update the Jinja templates in the `_templates/`
directory.

**Enjoy!**
